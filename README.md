## Customization (quick tips)

- Content lives in `src/app` and `public/data` — edit the JSON files and components under `src/app/components`.
- Replace images in `public/images` and update paths in your components.
- Update site metadata (title, description) in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `next.config.ts` if needed.
- Deploy with Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred host.
